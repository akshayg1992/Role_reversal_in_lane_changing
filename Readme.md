This project analyzes the reciprocity theory in lane change behaviour. Two new algorithms have been proposed: (i) BTRAP and (ii) RegimeX. 
The BTARP algorithm is used to accurately identify the lane change initiation point. 
The RegimeX algorithm is used to extract the follower vehicle decision at the point of lane change initiation. 
For this project, the NGSIM dataset was used.
